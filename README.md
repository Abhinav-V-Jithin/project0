# project0

This project is all about myself.

You may find many files in this project.

So, here are some instructions about opening of the files:

  1.To get the output do not open CSS files.
  
  2.Styles are all included in CSS files. So, if you wish to see it's code you can open it.
  
  3.Outputs are all in the .html files.
  
  4.If you want to see the output of the project, first of all open the 'index.html'.
  
Wishing you all the best...
